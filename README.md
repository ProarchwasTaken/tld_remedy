# Synopsis
**True Human Tribulation: Remedy** is an Action Adventure game where the
player must explore an map of maze like architecture, and defeat the boss
at the end. All the while, they must try their best to avoid unnecessary 
battles, and carefully manage their resources so they don't end up too 
weak to cross the metaphorical "finish line".

The game is currently in it's early pre-alpha stages. So feedback, and 
constructive criticism is very much appreciated. I'm currently focused on
building the game's core mechanics and systems, while also refining what's
built. Possible the most experimental phase of development as everything
is subject to change.
