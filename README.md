# Synopsis
**True Human Tribulation: Remedy** is an Action Adventure game where the
player must explore an map of maze like architecture, and defeat the boss
at the end. All the while, they must try their best to avoid unnecessary 
battles, and carefully manage their resources so they don't end up too 
weak to cross the metaphorical "finish line".

The game is currently in it's prototyping stages. So feedback, and 
constructive criticism is very much appreciated. I'm currently focused on
building and testing the game's fundamental mechanics to see whether if 
the idea is worth expanding upon, or I need to take a difference approach.

At the time of writing this, I'm looking for feedback on the game's 
movement, and collision system. As well as feedback on how the game runs
on lower end devices.
